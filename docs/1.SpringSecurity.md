# SpringSecurity

Spring Security is a security management framework in the Spring family. Compared to Shiro, it provides richer functions
and community resources than Shiro.

Generally, medium to large projects use SpringSecurity as a security framework.

There are more small projects with Shiro, because compared to SpringSecurity Shiro is easier to get started.

Web applications typically require **authentication** and **authorization**.

1. **Authentication**: Verify that current access system is the system of the project, and which user is it?
2. **Authorization**: After authentication, determine whether current user hash permission to perform a certain action.
